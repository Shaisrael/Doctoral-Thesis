Video 2.1: Differential odor-induced backward locomotion - Example of w1118 responses to ACV (left), GA (middle) and 2-butanone (right).
Video 2.2: Differential odor-induced backward locomotion of starved flies: Example of starved w1118 responses to ACV (left) and 2-butanone (right).

Chapter 3:

Video 3.1: Backward locomotion following optogenetic activation of GH146II-GAL4 - Example of backward locomotion following a 2-s blue light pulse (470 nm) in flies carrying GH146II-GAL4 and UAS-ChR2-XXM.
Video 3.2: GH146II-GAL4-induced, MDN-independent, backward locomotion.  Left, example of the efficiency of TNT in silencing MDNs. The VT50660-GAL4 (MDNs) driver was used to drive UAS-CsChrimson, and the VT44845-LexA (MDN-LexA) was used to drive LexAop-TNT. Right, example of backward locomotion generated by activation of GH146II-GAL4 with UAS-CsChrimson while VT44845-LexA (MDN-LexA) driving LexAop-TNT was used to silence MDNs.
