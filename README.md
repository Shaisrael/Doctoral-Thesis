Video 2.1: Differential odor-induced backward locomotion - Example of w1118 responses to ACV (left), GA (middle) and 2-butanone (right).

Video 2.2: Differential odor-induced backward locomotion of starved flies: Example of starved w1118 responses to ACV (left) and 2-butanone (right).


Chapter 3:

Video 3.1: Backward locomotion following optogenetic activation of GH146II-GAL4 - Example of backward locomotion following a 2-s blue light pulse (470 nm) in flies carrying GH146II-GAL4 and UAS-ChR2-XXM.

Video 3.2: GH146II-GAL4-induced, MDN-independent, backward locomotion.  Left, example of the efficiency of TNT in silencing MDNs. The VT50660-GAL4 (MDNs) driver was used to drive UAS-CsChrimson, and the VT44845-LexA (MDN-LexA) was used to drive LexAop-TNT. Right, example of backward locomotion generated by activation of GH146II-GAL4 with UAS-CsChrimson while VT44845-LexA (MDN-LexA) driving LexAop-TNT was used to silence MDNs. 

Video 3.3: GH146II-GAL4 VNC neurons cannot induce backward locomotion. Left, example of backward locomotion in MDN3-GAL4 driving UAS-ChR2-XXM in decapitated flies. Right, example of lack of backward locomotion in GH146II-GAL4 driving UAS-ChR2-XXM in decapitated flies. Note the oscillatory movement of the forelegs.

Video 3.4: Blocking expression in VNC neurons does not impair optogenetically-induced backward locomotion. Left, example of the efficiency of tsh-GAL80 to block VNC expression in decapitated flies carrying GH146II-GAL4, UAS-CsChrimson and tsh-GAL80. No foreleg movement is observed following optogenetic activation. Right, example of backward locomotion in NP5288-GAL4 driving UAS-CsChrimson in intact flies when expression in VNC was blocked using tsh-GAL80.

Video 3.5: Confocal stack of the GH146II-GAL4 SPARC mosaic fly used for MooSEZ three-dimensional light microscope reconstruction. Translational movie running through the entire central brain from the posterior to the anterior aspect (left) or from the anterior to the posterior aspect (right) of a fly in which the left MooSEZ was sparsely targeted to express CsChrimson::tdTomato using the SPARC method. To generate the movies, each confocal section (1 Î¼m) of the original stacks (144 slices) was converted into a video frame.

Video 3.6: Blocking expression in VNC neurons enhances backward locomotion in NP5288-GAL4 flies. Left, example of backward locomotion in NP5288-GAL4 driving UAS-CsChrimson. Note the strong oscillatory foreleg movement. Right, example of backward locomotion in NP5288-GAL4 with subtracted GH146-QF driving UAS-CsChrimson. Note the absence of oscillatory foreleg movement and increase in backward locomotion.

Video 3.7: Unilateral activation of MooSEZs triggers ipsilateral backward rotation. Left, example of backward turning in GH146II-GAL4 SPARC mosaic fly expressing CsChrimson in the right MooSEZ. Right, example of backward turning in GH146II-GAL4 SPARC mosaic fly expressing CsChrimson in the left MooSEZ.
